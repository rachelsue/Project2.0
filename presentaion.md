## Intro - Team Seeking Bobs Approval

# Concept
An application which would allow you to get the nutritional information from any meal you construct, using a NPM package containing the USDA nutritional database.

We used FoodWeb to query a database of over 300,000 food products, from produce to branded items, and wanted to allow a user to construct an exact meal, down to the gram.

The user would search for an ingredient, select the specific one from a list, and provide the quantity of the ingredient.  These would then be summed up and tabulated.

# Team
Nic - I attempted to sketch the overall layout of the application, and work on the API and HTML routes, the controllers, the handlebars pages, helped rachel with databases and created some of the models.  I created two APIs and tried to link them with our databases.  I think I tried to do too many things, and was being pulled in 4 different directions at once.  I believe that none of us were very confident with sequelize, and small bugs, generated everywhere from git hub to mysql slowed us down tremendously.  I believe its still a good idea, and with more time and experience this would have turned out alot better.  I do believe we all learned alot, despite not having much of a show for it.  

Rachel- I worked on the models for the database (datatypes, relationships between tables w keys) 
Got google authentitor working (took some time to get the information to log into the user database)
(used npms passort and cookieSession and 
keys file to hide info)
Learned how to use EJS to pull user information onto a profile page

Harrison- I helped intitally with desiging the layout as far as how many pages we wanted. A login, a main page. I also helped start the google authentication, with attempting to set up routes for Auth and having page go to google to login and then return to the main page, which actually came to life after Rachel stepped in to assist.

Wilson- I started by trying to work with some front end design, sadly I wasn't thinking straight and wasted time trying to do this with html files instead of handlebars. The biggest issue I had with the project was trying to get my local server to work, most of the time I was unable to get the server running to be able to get my localhost up to try and mess with the design.

# Lessons Learned

nic- We were poor at planning the steps to the project, inefficient at dividing the load, and did not get enough help when it was availiable.  Our site is fairly ugly, as we did not have much time to focus on the front end with the back end so flawed. 

harrison - Getting a quicker start on the project so we would have more time to really hammer out the issues we were having with the project.

Life happens sometimes.

wilson - Having a smooth start with getting your local servers up and running first makes a big difference.  

rachel -

We sought Bob's approval, and fell well short.
